# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 2026

Orthodox Companion is designed with your privacy in mind. We recognize that spiritual practice is personal, and we approach your information with the same sense of responsibility and restraint.

---

## What We Collect

Orthodox Companion does not collect, transmit, or share any personal information. The app does not currently communicate with any external server. There is currently no account creation, login, or registration of any kind.

Orthodox Companion does not collect personal information from any user, regardless of age. The app does not require or request any identifying information, and no data is transmitted from the device. Because no personal information is collected from any user, Orthodox Companion complies with obligations under applicable age-related privacy regulations, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

## Data Storage

All app data is stored locally on your device using standard on-device storage. This includes:

- Reading font size setting
- Onboarding completion status
- Notification preferences and reminder times
- calendar tradition preference (New Calendar or Old Calendar)

This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to Orthodox Companion, its developers, or any third party.

## Notifications

If users choose to enable daily reminders, the app uses local notifications. These notifications are generated and stored entirely on your device. No data is sent to any external server to schedule or deliver notifications.

## Tracking and Advertising

Orthodox Companion does not currently use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. There are no SDKs, no pixels, and no telemetry of any kind. Your fasting observances, prayer activity, and reading history are never recorded or transmitted.

Because Orthodox Companion does not track user activity in any form, the app does not respond to "Do Not Track" browser signals, as there is no tracking to disable.

## Third-Party Data Sharing

Orthodox Companion does not currently share data with any third party. No third party has access to user data through this app, because no user data exists outside your device. We do not provide any information to analytics tools, advertising networks, SDKs, or data brokers.

## Data Retention and Deletion

All data generated within Orthodox Companion is stored locally on your device and is retained only while the app remains installed. To delete all locally stored data, delete the app from your device. Upon deletion, your device’s operating system removes all locally stored preferences and settings in accordance with its standard data management processes. The app does not transmit user-generated content to any external server.

## Managing Preferences and Data

Users may manage certain app permissions and data directly through their device settings:

- **Notifications:** Notification permissions may be enabled, disabled, or modified at any time through the device’s system settings.
- **Locally Stored Data:** Data stored locally on the device may be removed by deleting the app. Removal is carried out by the device’s operating system in accordance with its standard data management processes.
- **Account Data (If applicable):** Orthodox Companion does not currently create user accounts; there is no account deletion process required. If future versions of this app offer account-based features, users will be provided with information regarding how to access, modify, or request deletion of associated personal information, as described in the applicable Privacy Policy.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, features, or legal requirements. If we introduce features that involve data collection, account creation, or server communication, we will update this policy accordingly and make reasonable efforts to notify users before any such changes take effect. When changes are made, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically. Your continued use of Orthodox Companion after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
