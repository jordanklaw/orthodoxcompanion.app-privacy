# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 2026

Orthodox Companion is designed with your privacy in mind. We recognize that spiritual practice is personal, and we approach your information with the same sense of responsibility and restraint.

---

## What We Collect

Orthodox Companion does not collect, transmit, or share any personal information. The app does not communicate with any server. There is no account creation, no login, and no registration of any kind.

## Local Storage Only

All app data is stored locally on your device using standard iOS storage (UserDefaults). This includes:

- Your calendar tradition preference (New Calendar or Old Calendar)
- Reading font size setting
- Notification preferences and reminder times
- Onboarding completion status

This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to Orthodox Companion, its developers, or any third party.

## Notifications

If you choose to enable daily reminders, the app uses iOS local notifications only. These notifications are generated and stored entirely on your device. No data is sent to any external server to schedule or deliver notifications.

## No Tracking

Orthodox Companion does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. There are no SDKs, no pixels, and no telemetry of any kind. Your fasting observances, prayer activity, and reading history are never recorded or transmitted.

Because Orthodox Companion does not track user activity in any form, the app does not respond to "Do Not Track" browser signals, as there is no tracking to disable.

## No Third-Party Data Sharing

Because Orthodox Companion collects no data, there is no data to share. We do not provide any information to third-party analytics tools, advertising networks, SDKs, or data brokers. No parent, subsidiary, or affiliated entity has access to user data through this app, because no user data exists outside your device.

## Data Retention and Deletion

All data generated by Orthodox Companion is stored locally on your device and is retained only for as long as the app is installed. To delete all data associated with Orthodox Companion, simply delete the app from your device. Upon deletion, all locally stored preferences and settings are permanently removed by iOS. No data persists on any server or external system, because none was ever transmitted.

## Managing Your Preferences and Revoking Consent

You are in full control of the data stored on your device:

- **Notifications:** You can disable or modify notification permissions at any time through your device's Settings > Notifications > Orthodox Companion.
- **All local data:** You can reset all preferences by deleting and reinstalling the app, or permanently remove all data by deleting the app entirely.
- **No account to delete:** Because Orthodox Companion does not create user accounts, there is no account deletion process required.

## Children's Privacy

Orthodox Companion does not collect personal information from any user, regardless of age. The app does not require or request any identifying information, and no data is transmitted from the device. Because no personal information is collected, Orthodox Companion complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar regulations by design.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, features, or legal requirements. If we introduce features that involve data collection, account creation, or server communication, we will update this policy accordingly and notify users through the app before any such changes take effect. When changes are made, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically. Your continued use of Orthodox Companion after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
