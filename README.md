# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 2026

Orthodox Companion is built with your privacy in mind. Spiritual practice is personal, and the app is designed to reflect that same sense of responsibility and restraint.

This Privacy Policy describes how Orthodox Companion (“the App”) handles information in connection with its operation.

---

## Scope of this Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to information processed by Orthodox Companion through the App.

App distribution platforms, device manufacturers, and operating system providers may collect information in accordance with their own privacy policies. This Policy does not govern the data practices of third parties outside the App.

---

## Information We Process

Orthodox Companion is designed to operate without requiring users to provide personal information in order to access its core functionality.

- The app is designed to function without transmitting user-generated content to external servers.

- Orthodox Companion does not require account creation, login, or registration to use its current features.

---

## Local Device Data

This app stores certain settings locally on your device using standard on-device storage. This may include:

- Reading font size preference

- Onboarding completion status

- Notification preferences and reminder times

- Calendar tradition preference (New Calendar or Old Calendar)

This information is stored within the app’s local container on your device. The app does not transmit this locally stored data to external servers.

---

## Notifications

If enabled, this app uses device-based local notifications to deliver reminders. Notification scheduling and delivery are handled by the operating system on your device. This app does not use remote notification servers for its current reminder functionality.

---

## Analytics and Tracking

Orthodox Companion does not use third-party analytics SDKs, advertising networks, or cross-app tracking technologies at this time.

This app is designed not to record or transmit user devotional activity, including fasting observances, prayer usage, or reading history, to external services.

---

## Third-Party Data Sharing

This app does not share user-generated content with third parties, integrate advertising networks, data brokers, or external analytics services in its current version.

---

## Data Retention and Deletion

Data stored by Orthodox Companion remains on your device unless the App is deleted.

If you delete the App, locally stored data within the App’s container is removed by your device’s operating system in accordance with its standard data management processes.

The App does not maintain user-generated content on external servers in its current version.

---

## Managing Permissions and Device Settings

You may manage certain permissions directly through your device settings, including:

- **Notifications:** Enable, disable, or modify notification permissions through your device’s system settings.

- **Locally Stored Data:** Removing the App from your device will remove locally stored app data in accordance with your operating system’s processes.

If future versions of the App introduce account-based features or server-side functionality, information regarding access, correction, or deletion of associated personal information will be provided in an updated Privacy Policy.

---

## Legal Rights

Depending on applicable law, individuals may have rights relating to personal information, including rights to request access, correction, deletion, or restriction of processing where such information is processed.

If future versions of the App involve the collection or processing of personal information, this Policy will be updated to describe those practices and applicable rights.

---

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in features, legal requirements, or data practices. 

If material changes are made, we will update the “Last updated” date above and, where appropriate, provide notice through the App or other reasonable means. 

Continued use of the App following updates indicates acknowledgment of the revised Policy.
